# üåç **Multivariate Analysis of CO2 Emissions Using Machine Learning**

This project analyzes the **factors influencing CO2 emissions** in France through **machine learning models**. Using both **economic** and **environmental** data, the objective is to identify how variables like **industry value-added**, **energy consumption**, and **GDP per capita** affect CO2 emissions. The results provide valuable insights for policy-making and environmental management.

## **Project Overview**

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - The dataset was cleaned and prepared for analysis to ensure reliability.
   - Missing values were interpolated linearly to maintain data trends.
   - Non-numeric columns were converted into usable formats.
   - The variable `GDP_Per_Capita` was calculated as the ratio between GDP and Population to replace an outlier-ridden variable.
   - Highly correlated variables (e.g., exports and imports) were reduced to a single representative feature to avoid multicollinearity.

2. **Correlation Analysis**  
   - **Industry value-added** and **CO2 emissions** show a strong positive correlation (+0.79), indicating that the industrial sector is a major contributor to emissions.
   - **Electric power consumption** has a negative correlation (-0.67) with emissions, suggesting that cleaner energy sources or infrastructure efficiency may play a role.
   - **GDP per capita** shows a strong negative correlation (-0.77), likely due to the adoption of green technologies and policies in wealthier economies.

## **Conclusions**

1. **Industry** is the most significant driver of CO2 emissions, with an increase in industrial contribution to GDP correlating with higher emissions.
2. The **energy mix** plays a crucial role, where clean energy sources (e.g., nuclear, renewables) reduce emissions compared to fossil fuels.
3. **GDP per capita** acts as a mitigating factor, likely due to investments in green technologies and environmental policies.
4. **Energy efficiency** has a moderate impact, helping to curb emissions despite increased energy consumption.
5. **Exports** have a limited direct impact, possibly due to the underlying influence of industrial and energy sectors.
